There are two main parts of this program:
1, Get photos from twitter by using Twitter API, using Google Vision API to analysis and describe the content and FFMPEG to convert the taged images to videos.
2, Store related information such as username, twitter name for download, download twitter number, download photo number, photo strore location, video store location and aslo the action time by to ways: one is the MySQL database, anothe one is the MongoDB.
3, Implement the function of search for some keyword to see whether it is in the database, if so print the information in the exact user/session and so on.

To use my API for your own project, you can simply download all python files and just "impory Mini3_API" for using the functions and code.

The following photos show the result, MySQL database and MongoDB of my project:
